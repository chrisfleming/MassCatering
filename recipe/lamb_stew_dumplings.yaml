    0. Cut lamb neck into 2.5cm cubes. Pell the onions. Large dice the carrot and swede together. Finely chop 1/3rd of the rosemary
    1. Preheat the oven to 120C/250F/Gas 0.5.
    2. Season the lamb and dust with 10-20% of the flour. Place a heavy-bottom casserole dish over a medium heat, add the olive oil and butter then the lamb. Fry until golden-brown. Remove the lamb and keep to one side.
    3. Reduce the heat and fry the onions, carrots and swede until caramelised. Add the wine and simmer until the volume of liquid has reduced by half, then add the lamb back in with the lamb stock. Bring the stew to a simmer then add the bay leaf and the non-chopped 2/3rds of the rosemary. Cover with a lid, transfer the pan to the oven and bake for one hour.
    4. For the dumplings, mix the remaining flour, suet, baking powder and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Add the remaining finely chopped rosemary then gradually stir in 3–5 tablespoons of cold water, or enough to form a sticky dough. Flour your hands and then roll the dough into 12 small balls. Place on a plate in the fridge to chill.
    5. When the lamb stew is ready, place the dumplings on the top of the stew and put the lid back on. Return the stew to the oven for 10 minutes or until the dumplings are fluffy and cooked through. (Alternatively, if you are short of space in your casserole dish, place 500ml/18fl oz lamb stock into a separate pan and bring to a simmer. Add the dumplings and simmer for 6–8 minutes. Discard the stock when the dumplings are cooked and set them aside to rest for a minute.)
    6. Add the parsley to the stew and serve equally between four shallow bowls with the dumplings.
