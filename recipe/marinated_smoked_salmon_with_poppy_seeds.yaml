ingredients:
    poppy_seed: 1 tbsp
    orange: 2
    red_wine_vinegar: 10ml
    olive_oil: 10ml
    sesame_oil: 2.5ml
    smoked salmon: 300ml
    raddish: 85g

    rye_bread: 9 slices
method: |
    1. Whisk together the poppy seeds, orange zest and juice, vinegar and oils with some black pepper and a pinch of salt – be sparing with the salt, as smoked salmon is naturally quite salty.
    2. Carefully separate the slices of salmon, then put into a mixing bowl with most of the radishes and spring onions. Drizzle over the dressing and gently toss together lightly – using your hands is best. Let the salmon marinate for just 5-10 mins while you toast the bread – any longer and the vinegar will begin to 'cook' the fish.
    3. Spread the salmon over a large plate or platter, pour over any dressing left in the bowl, then scatter over the reserved radishes and spring onions. Bring to the table with toasted bread and a few forks, and let everyone help themselves.
