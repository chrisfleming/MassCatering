    1. Combine the squash, beans, coconut milk, stock and miso paste in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Heat, while stirring, until the miso dissolves, about 3 minutes.
    2. Blend the squash mixture until smooth and creamy with a hand-held blender. If the soup is too thick, add a bit more stock or water to reach the preferred consistency and keep warm.
    3. Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain and set aside.
    4. Add the soy sauce to the soup. Taste and season with salt or more miso if needed.
    5. Place a portion of noodles in each bowl, ladle the hot soup over the top. Drizzle with sriracha and garnish with spring onions, sesame seeds and coriander.
