method: |
    1. Peel the onion and chop finely.
    2. Heat the oil in a large saucepan and add the onion.  Fry gently over a low to medium heat for 3-4 minutes. 
    3. Add the stock the the pan, and season well with salt and black pepper. Bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes.
    4. Finely chop the parsley stalks, (setting aside the leaves for later). Add the frozen peas and parsley stalks to the pan, then simmer for a further 5 minutes.
    5. Use a slotted spoon to remove about a third of the vegetables to a bowl.
    6. Add the parsley and the lemon juice to the soup, then blitz to a very smooth pur√©e in a blender or using a hand blender in the saucepan.
    7. Tip the reserved vegetables back into the saucepan - these will provide a lovely chunky texture to the otherwise smooth soup.  Taste and adjust seasoning, then serve.
