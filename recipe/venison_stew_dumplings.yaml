method: |
    0. Preheat the oven to 150°C/Gas 2.
    1. Place the flour in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Toss the venison in the flour to coat. In a large flameproof casserole heat 3 tablespoons oil.
    2. Fry the venison in batches to brown; you want a good caramel colour for the best flavour, so don't crowd the pan. Once browned, transfer the venison to a large bowl and set aside.
    3. Heat a little more oil in the pan and fry the onion, carrots, celery and garlic for a few minutes to soften.
    4. Add the wine, stock, dried mushrooms, redcurrant jelly, balsamic vinegar, juniper berries and herbs. Season with salt and pepper.
    5. Return the venison to the pan and bring to the boil. Cover and transfer to the oven. Cook for 2½-3 hours, until the meat is tender.
    6. For the dumplings, mix the remaining flour, suet, baking powder and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Add the remaining finely chopped rosemary then gradually stir in 3–5 tablespoons of cold water, or enough to form a sticky dough. Flour your hands and then roll the dough into 12 small balls. Place on a plate in the fridge to chill.
    7. When the stew is ready, place the dumplings on the top of the stew and put the lid back on. Return the stew to the oven for 10 minutes or until the dumplings are fluffy and cooked through. (Alternatively, if you are short of space in your casserole dish, place 500ml/18fl oz lamb stock into a separate pan and bring to a simmer. Add the dumplings and simmer for 6–8 minutes. Discard the stock when the dumplings are cooked and set them aside to rest for a minute.)
    8. Make mash with potatoes, celeriac and butter
    7. Serve with baguettes for extra carbs
