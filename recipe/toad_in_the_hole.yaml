method: |
    1. Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7.
    2. Put the 12 chipolatas in a 20 x 30cm roasting tin with 1 tbsp sunflower oil, then bake for 15 mins until browned.
    3. Meanwhile, make up the batter mix. Tip 140g plain flour into a bowl with ½ tsp salt, make a well in the middle and crack 2 eggs into it.
    4. Use an electric whisk to mix it together, then slowly add 175ml semi-skimmed milk, whisking all the time. Leave to stand until the sausages are nice and brown.
    5. Remove the sausages from the oven – be careful because the fat will be sizzling hot – but if it isn’t, put the tin on the hob for a few mins until it is.
    6. Pour in the batter mix, transfer to the top shelf of the oven, then cook for 25-30 mins, until risen and golden.
    7. Serve with gravy and your favourite veg.
