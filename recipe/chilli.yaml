method: |
   1. Prepare your vegetables. Chop vegetables into medium dice.
   2. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot.
   3. Add the chorizo and onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.
   4. Tip in the garlic, red pepper, chilli powder, paprika and ground cumin. Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
   5. Brown minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon. Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits.
   6. Add beef stock into the pan with the mince mixture. Add a 400g can of chopped tomatoes, herbs and add a good shake of salt and pepper. Squirt in about tomato pur√©e and stir the sauce well.
   7. Simmer it gently. Bring the whole thing to the boil, give it a good stir and put a lid on the pan. Turn down the heat until it is gently bubbling and leave it for 20 minutes.
   8. Drain and rinse red kidney beans and half of the dark chocolate and stir them into the chilli pot. Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes, adding a little more water if it looks too dry. Then season to taste and add more dark chocolate if required.
   9. Replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave your chilli to stand for 10 minutes before serving.
   10. Serve with soured cream and plain boiled long grain rice.
