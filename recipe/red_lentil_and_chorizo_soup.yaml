    1. Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the chorizo and cook until crisp and it has released its oils. Remove with a slotted spoon into a bowl, leaving the fat in the pan.
    2. Fry the onion, carrots and cumin seeds for 10 mins until soft and glistening, then add the garlic and fry for 1 min more. Scatter over the paprika and sugar, cook for 1 min, then splash in the vinegar.
    3. Simmer for a moment, then stir in the lentils, and pour over the tomatoes and chicken stock.
    4. Give it a good stir, then simmer for 30 mins or until the lentils are tender.
    5. Blitz with a hand blender until smooth-ish but still chunky.
